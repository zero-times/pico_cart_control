# ADR-001: NNAPI Execution Provider for Hardware Acceleration

**Status:** Rejected  
**Date:** 2026-01-26  
**Decision Makers:** @siva-sub  

## Context

NekoSpeak TTS uses ONNX Runtime for neural network inference on Android. Users requested GPU/NPU hardware acceleration to improve inference speed. Android's Neural Networks API (NNAPI) is the standard interface for hardware acceleration on Android devices.

## Investigation Summary

### What Was Tested

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| NNAPI Execution Provider | Built into ONNX Runtime Android AAR |
| Kokoro 82M Model | INT8 quantized (3412 nodes) |
| Pocket-TTS Models | INT8 quantized + FP32 versions |

### Test Results

#### Device: OnePlus CPH2663 (Android 16)

```
ExecutionProviderFactory: NNAPI is available on this device ✓
```

#### Kokoro Model (INT8)
```
NnapiExecutionProvider::GetCapability
- Partitions supported by NNAPI: 103
- Nodes in graph: 3412
- Nodes supported by NNAPI: 903 (~26%)

FATAL: op_builder_helpers.cc:144 AddNnapiSplit count [0] 
       does not evenly divide dimension 1 [256]
```
**Result:** Session creation fails, fallback to CPU required.

#### Pocket-TTS Models

| Model | Nodes | NNAPI Supported | Result |
|-------|-------|-----------------|--------|
| mimi_encoder (FP32) | 216 | 3 (1.4%) | Compiled on nnapi-reference |
| flow_lm_main (FP32) | 1109 | 31 (2.8%) | ANEURALNETWORKS_BAD_DATA |
| flow_lm_flow (FP32) | 447 | 31 (6.9%) | ANEURALNETWORKS_BAD_DATA |
| mimi_decoder (FP32) | - | - | Falls back to CPU |

**Result:** FP32 models load but NNAPI compilation fails due to unsupported ops.

### FP32 Model Testing (Bypassing Quantization Ops)

Since INT8 models use `DynamicQuantizeLinear` and `MatMulInteger` ops that NNAPI doesn't support, we tested FP32 (full precision) models from [KevinAHM/pocket-tts-onnx](https://huggingface.co/KevinAHM/pocket-tts-onnx/tree/main/onnx).

#### FP32 Model Op Analysis

| Model | Total Nodes | Quantization Ops | Key Ops |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|---------|
| flow_lm_main.onnx (FP32) | 2165 | ❌ None | MatMul, Add, Mul, Reshape, Gather |
| flow_lm_flow.onnx (FP32) | ~500 | ❌ None | MatMul, Conv, Add |  
| mimi_decoder.onnx (FP32) | ~300 | ❌ None | Conv, Add, Transpose |
| kokoro_82m.onnx (FP32) | 2469 | ❌ None | MatMul, Gemm, Conv, LayerNorm |

**Finding:** FP32 models have **no quantization ops** - they should theoretically be more NNAPI-friendly than INT8.

#### FP32 Test Results

```
Model selection: NNAPI=true, using FP32 models ✓
Loading model: flow_lm_main.onnx (288MB) ✓

NnapiExecutionProvider::GetCapability
- Nodes in graph: 1109
- Nodes supported by NNAPI: 31 (2.8%)  ← Still very low!

FATAL: model_builder.cc:511 Compile ResultCode: ANEURALNETWORKS_BAD_DATA
       on identifyInputsAndOutputs
```

**Conclusion:** Even FP32 models fail due to **dynamic shapes** and **unsupported op patterns**, not just quantization ops. The models use:
- Dynamic sequence lengths in MatMul/Gemm
- Gather with dynamic indices
- Reshape with computed dimensions

These patterns are fundamentally incompatible with NNAPI's static graph compilation.

### Root Causes

1. **Dynamic Shapes**: Models use dynamic batch/sequence dimensions that NNAPI cannot handle
2. **Unsupported Ops**: 
   - `Split` with incompatible dimension division
   - `MatMul` with dynamic shapes
   - `DynamicQuantizeLinear` / `MatMulInteger` (INT8 quantization ops)
3. **Low Node Coverage**: Only 1-26% of model nodes are NNAPI-compatible
4. **Device Fallback**: Test device uses `nnapi-reference` (CPU-only reference implementation)

## Options Considered

### Option 1: Enable NNAPI with Automatic Fallback (Implemented & Reverted)

**Implementation:**
- `ExecutionProviderFactory.kt` - Cached NNAPI availability check
- `PrefsManager.kt` - `useNnapi` toggle preference
- `SettingsScreen.kt` - Conditional UI toggle based on device support
- Engine modifications - Try NNAPI, catch failure, retry with CPU

**Pros:**
- Graceful degradation when NNAPI fails
- Future-proofs for better device/model support

**Cons:**
- Adds complexity for minimal benefit today
- ~400MB extra FP32 model downloads for NNAPI mode
- 5-30% inference overhead from failed NNAPI attempts
- User confusion: "toggle exists but doesn't accelerate"

### Option 2: QNN Execution Provider (Qualcomm Neural Network SDK)

**Pros:**
- Full Qualcomm DSP/NPU acceleration
- Better op coverage than NNAPI

**Cons:**
- Requires custom ONNX Runtime build with QNN AAR
- Models need export with fixed shapes (no dynamic dimensions)
- Qualcomm-only (excludes MediaTek, Samsung Exynos)

### Option 3: XNNPACK Backend Optimization

**Pros:**
- Already working (CPU optimized)
- No model changes required
- Cross-device compatible

**Cons:**
- No GPU/NPU acceleration
- Limited by CPU thermal throttling

### Option 4: Vulkan Compute Shaders

**Pros:**
- Cross-platform GPU support
- Wide device compatibility

**Cons:**
- Requires custom inference implementation
- Significant development effort
- Not integrated with ONNX Runtime

## Decision

**Rejected NNAPI integration at this time.**

### Rationale

1. **Cost-Benefit**: Implementation complexity (~400 lines) vs. zero acceleration benefit on tested devices
2. **Model Incompatibility**: Current models have fundamental op incompatibilities with NNAPI
3. **Device Reality**: Most Android devices use `nnapi-reference` CPU fallback, not actual accelerators
4. **User Experience**: A non-functional toggle creates confusion

### Recommendations for Future

1. **Model Re-export**: If considering NNAPI again, re-export models from PyTorch with:
   - Fixed input shapes (no dynamic dimensions)
   - NNAPI-friendly ops only (avoid Split, Gather with dynamic indices)
   - Static quantization (not dynamic)

2. **QNN Investigation**: For Qualcomm devices specifically, QNN EP with fixed-shape models may provide real acceleration

3. **Thread Optimization**: Current CPU execution with configurable thread count (user setting) provides good performance without complexity
